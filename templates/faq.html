      <section>
        <hr style="width: 100%;">
        <p>We want to build a supervised machine learning model for SCOPE to trigger alerts more like a human would rather than rule-based which is what we are limited to now since we don't have data to train the model on.  In order to make sure that we are triggering what our <em>users</em> call alerts, we need to get input from them!</p>

      <section>
        <hr style="width: 100%;">
        <p>Once we have built up a database of responses from SCOPE users, we will split the data into two sets: a training set and a test set (an uneven split). We will then use the training set to train possible machine learning models (think classification, random forests, clustering, etc.). Each of the models will then be tested on the test data (the unseen data). The model that performs best on the unseen data will be our new model! Of course, we will continue to tweak things from there (and collect more input from our users).</p>

      <section>
        <hr style="width: 100%;">
        <p>Since we are collecting this data to be smarter about how we trigger alerts, why not name it after a <b>Greek goddess of knowledge and deep thought</b>?!</p>
        <div>From Wikipedia:</div>
        <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metis_(mythology)">Metis (&Mu;&#942;&tau;&iota;&sigmaf;, "wisdom," "skill," or "craft"), in ancient Greek religion, was a mythological character belonging to the Titan generation. [...] By the era of Greek philosophy in the 5th century BC, Metis had become the mother of wisdom and deep thought, [...] the embodiment of "prudence", "wisdom" or "wise counsel" [...] The Greek word metis meant a quality that combined wisdom and cunning.</blockquote>
